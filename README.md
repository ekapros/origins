# Origins
A Space Adventure to Teach Web Privacy - 
A repo for the Mozilla Privacy Arcade Game Jam Challenge, part of the 2017 Global Sprint.

**Objective**

"_The big idea is to invent and prototype a web-native game that helps players use what they learn about privacy and security to protect themselves on the web._"
From: https://github.com/MozillaFoundation/mpa-game-jam-challenge

Specifically, the _Origins_ game will focus on designing the game at this stage. Contributors are welcome to take it to the next level, i.e., implementation.

**Learning Outcomes**

_Target audience_: 14-16 years old web users

_Level_: Beginner web users

_21st Century Skills_: Problem Solving, Creativity, Communication

_Origins_ a space adventure, where it is 3017 and the humans of Mars try to identify their origins. Some parties are interested in not disclosing this info, so **finding and protecting info** is essential.

This makes the game larger than the originally intended micro-games by Mozilla, but the fact that there is a story makes it easy to add pedagogical scaffolding that gives context to the learners to relate to. I give the story line and ideas for puzzles within the story, which I think should be plug-and-play. However, they should go from easier to harder.

**To Do**

- Storyboarding
- Digital Design
- Programming
- User testing (throughout)
- Accessibility


- The story could be appropriated as a board game for offline learning.
