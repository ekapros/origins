**Origins. Chapter 1.**

Mars, 3017. Jaonora just finished school in the small town of Troy, in the Gusev crater of the Ma’adim Vallis. She was bored. Most people of Troy were farmers, harvesting the bright white silica foam at the nearby Silica Valley. Today at school they were taught how these farmers where pioneers who cultivated the land and saved the Ma’adim Vallis from an environmental disaster, caused by the failed Space Exploration of the 25th Century.

Jaonora was bored. She had heard the stories again and again. However, she was not convinced: she believed that the farmers were not pioneers, but boring. At 15 years old, she didn’t want to settle in a farmers’ colony: she wanted to go on an adventure. Surely the Space Exploration era was not the dark age everyone said it to be, but an era of adventure and discovery. What a great time it must have been! That’s what she was thinking when she started going up the Home Plate of the Columbia Hills, instead of going home. That’s what Jaonora would do. Instead of going home after school, she would go up the hilltop and imagine of adventures.

Jaonora there records her thoughts on her audio-journal. [audio-journal added to inventory]

After her recording, Jaonora did something unusual. Instead of going home, like most days, she started wondering towards the valley. There, in a shaft, not unlike the silica harvesting shafts, she saw it. [click to add audio-disc to inventory].

The audio goes like this: a music-box children’s music starts to play for a few seconds. Then, a little girl starts reading numbers in a stern voice: Three, four, five, seven, one. Three, four, five, seven, one. Nine, two…

[34571, 34571, 92860, 76752, 92860, 76752, 17543, 17543]

Once the numbers stopped, the music resumed for a while. Then it stopped. The audio disc was otherwise totally empty. Jaonora was shocked. First of, she hadn’t seen an audio disc like that before. It seemed ancient: how on Mars did her audio recorder still _play_ this thing? Plus, it _was_ ancient; only the old mBámra had an accent as close to that of the girl in the recording, and mBámra was at least 120 years old. She decided to go find mBámra and talk to him.

> mB: How may I be of assistance, young lady?

> J: This. [plays recording]

> mB: Ah, now. I see you played that in your audio recorder. What permission does your audio app have?

[A. Auto saves to the web everything it plays.
B. Only plays files locally, on the machine. I think.
C. Permi… eh, what? I have no idea? I just press play…
D. What are permissions again?

onClick():
A. So, you may be found. B. You think? So, you’re not sure. If this is not true, you may be found. C. Definition. D. Definition.

> mB: You need to hide. You’re not safe.

> J: Why?

> mB: They’ll find you. You’ve left a data trail. A data trail is [definition].

[Q: Does recording on an audio-journal leave a data trail?

A. Yes, always. B. Yes, but only if it saves the recording on the web. C. No, never. D. Can I have an audio-journal? Please?

onClick():
A. Hmmm, not exactly (data trail definition). B. That is correct! (data trail definition) C. Hmmm, not exactly (data trail definition). D. Apologies, we do not currently ship to Planet Earth (location auto-detected from your IP). ]

> J: Who will find me?

> mB: You need to hide. You’re not safe.

Jaonora was delighted and furious at the same time. _Hide_? Of course not! All these years, she had been looking for an adventure, and now that one knocked on her door, she would _hide_? There was no way she was doing that!

However, she also decided to protect herself from whoever might be after her. She thought about what mBámra had said, about the data trail. What could be an effective way to protect my data, she wondered.

[A. Check Permissions. B. Protect files with a Password. C. All of the above. D. None of the above.]

[Password quiz. Why you need one explanation.
A good password is:
A. 123456 B. password C. My birthday D. (input) ]

TO DO:

Jaonora is found by government agents. They found her by her IP. [IP location quiz].

They don’t know what’s going on either. They give her access to the State’s library. There Jaonora finds the code for the message:

[Code:
34571: Start message
92860: Abandon
40968: Do not Abandon
76752: Planet
17543: End message ]

She asks agents, who point back to the dark age of the Space Exploration and send her away. They’re busy.

Jaonora goes back to mBámra.
